This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [
`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed
> the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the
following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native
deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
pod install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
